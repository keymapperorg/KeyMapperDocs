# KeyMapperDocs
The mkdocs documentation website for the Key Mapper app. This used to be in the KeyMapper repo.

## Building

To build the documentation website you need to install [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) with Python. Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root of the project to install all the necessary dependencies. Then run `mkdocs serve` in the project root to run the server.
