## Floating buttons and floating layouts

Floating buttons are on-screen overlays that you can tap to run actions as part of a key map.

Floating layouts are arrangements of floating button, on-screen overlays that you can tap to run actions as part of a key map. You can map floating buttons in the same way you can remap physical keys, like volume buttons.

## Editing floating layouts

When you see the bubble icon overlaid on your screen, you are in the process of editing a floating layout.

## Add buttons

To add buttons, tap the bubble icon, and tap 'add button'. This launches an activity to set up a new button. You can choose a label for the button, and set its size. Tap 'done' when you are happy with the appearance of the button.

You can now move the button around your screen by dragging it with your finger. In the background, you can launch apps to help you align the button with where you want to use it.

If you are trying to add a floating button to a key map, you can tap the button and choose 'use trigger'.

!!! note
    The button will hide if you pull down the notification bar or if it would obstruct an on-screen keyboard.

## Switch layout

This option will allow you to change the floating layout that you are currently editing. Tapping 'switch layout' provides you with a list of layouts to choose from.

## Go back

When you're finished editing, 'go back' will take you back to Key Mapper. If you are trying to add a floating button to a key map, you can tap the button and choose 'use trigger'.

## Hide/show buttons

This option will toggle showing any floating buttons on the screen.
