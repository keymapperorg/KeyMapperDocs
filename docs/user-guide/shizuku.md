Shizuku is an app that allows other apps to do things that only system apps are allowed to do. This is not the same as rooting, which gives apps and the user ultimate control over the device. Read more about how it works on their [website](https://shizuku.rikka.app/introduction).

## How to set it up
Go to the Key Mapper settings -> Shizuku support.

## Benefits

- Input key events without having to use one of the Key Mapper keyboards. ðŸ¥³ You can use the keyboard that you already have such as Gboard for example.
- "Move cursor to end" action without having to use one of the Key Mapper keyboards.
- "Open menu" action should work in more apps than without using Shizuku.
- Grant Key Mapper WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission without you having to use ADB on a PC/Mac.
