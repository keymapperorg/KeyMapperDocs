    If you are on Android 11 or newer it is recommended that you install Shizuku. Read more about this [here](shizuku.md).
    
    If you don't want to install Shizuku then you ***must*** be using the Key Mapper GUI Keyboard or the Key Mapper Basic Input Method for this to work. Follow [this guide](../user-guide/key-mapper-keyboard.md) to set it up.
