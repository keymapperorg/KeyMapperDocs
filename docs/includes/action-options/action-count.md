!!! info "Key Mapper 2.1.0+"
    On Key Mapper 2.2.0 and 2.1.0 this is called "action count".

This option serves as a multiplier. If this is equal to 5 when your mapping is triggered then your action will be performed 5 times.
If this is used with the 'repeat' option then this will perform the action this many times every time it repeats.
