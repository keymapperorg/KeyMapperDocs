![](../../images/ui-slider-default-light-450px.png)

This option sets the time period for your repeating action. If this is set to 200, your action will repeat every 200ms, or in terms of frequency, 5 times per second. Some people prefer to think about this setting as a repeat rate, commonly measured in 'clicks' per second or cps. To calculate the appropriate time period for this option from a desired frequency, use this equation:

```
Time period (ms) = 1000 / Frequency ('cps')
```
