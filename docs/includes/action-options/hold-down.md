:material-checkbox-marked:{: .accent-light } &nbsp; Hold down

!!! info "Key Mapper 2.1.0+"

This setting provides the ability to simulate holding down a key or tapping a coordinate (Android 8.0+). With this turned on (and repeat turned off), the default behaviour is that holding down your trigger will translate to holding down the action, for as long as you hold down the trigger.
