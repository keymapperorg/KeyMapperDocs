When this is turned on, Key Mapper will execute your actions repeatedly. This is particularly useful when emulating a keyboard key press, where in most applications holding down the key would result in a repeating output. The default settings in Key Mapper are designed to emulate that behaviour when 'Repeat' is turned on.
