# Welcome to Key Mapper Documentation

[Key Mapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper) is the Android app for changing the buttons on your device.

The app intercepts key events and allows you to design your own custom actions when a certain key combination is pressed.

You can create on-screen floating buttons that behave like physical keys, which you can also design actions for.

The core functionality of the app is proudly free and open-source software (FOSS). Certain special features are available as paid add-ons.
